It’s a basic spring boot application based upon e-commerce background
There are four entities(products, customers, orders, shippings) and JPA repository.
I made rest controllers for all those tables/entities and a service interface with its implementations(i.e. serviceImpl).
I connected a local postgres database to my application for storing and retrieving the data entries.
I tested the api end points via “Bruno”
